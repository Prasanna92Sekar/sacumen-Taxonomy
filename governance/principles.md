# Taxonomy Principles

1. Taxonomy describes **meaning**, not log format
2. Labels must be vendor-neutral
3. Event type must belong to exactly one category
4. Attack type is optional and may be null
5. Backward compatibility is required
6. Changes require review

This taxonomy will evolve incrementally.
